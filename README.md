# DenseNet
This repo test run DenseNet with CIFAR-10 data, as described in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993). It reproduced the results of accuracy around 0.93.
The code is copied from [here](https://github.com/robertomest/convnet-study) and [here](https://github.com/tdeboissiere/DeepLearningImplementations/tree/master/DenseNet), with small changes. To run, use `python test_cifar10.py` after changing the data path and save file path accordingly.
